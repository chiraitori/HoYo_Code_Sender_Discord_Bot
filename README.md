 ## Usage

 ### Setup Command

 Use the `/setup` command to configure the notification roles and channels:

**Options:**

- `genshin_role` - Role to mention for Genshin Impact codes.
- `hsr_role` - Role to mention for Honkai: Star Rail codes.
- `zzz_role` - Role to mention for Zenless Zone Zero codes.
- `channel` - Channel where the codes will be sent.

### Setup Thread Command (Forum Threads)

Use the `/setupthread` command to configure dedicated permanent forum threads for each game:

**Required Options:**

- `genshin_thread` - Forum thread for Genshin Impact codes (must be a permanent thread).
- `hsr_thread` - Forum thread for Honkai: Star Rail codes (must be a permanent thread).
- `zzz_thread` - Forum thread for Zenless Zone Zero codes (must be a permanent thread).

**Optional Options (Role Overrides):**

- `genshin_role` - Override the role to mention for Genshin Impact (optional).

**Note:** The threads must be **permanent threads** in a **forum channel**. Auto-send will post codes to both the main channel (if configured) and the dedicated forum threads.

### Auto-send Options

Use the `/autosendoptions` command to control where codes are sent:

**Options:**

- `destination` - Choose where to send codes:
  - `both` - Send to both main channel and forum threads (default)
  - `channel_only` - Send only to main channel
  - `threads_only` - Send only to forum threads

This allows you to customize code delivery based on your server's needs.

- **Up to three codes** - Post multiple codes at once

**Options:**

- `status` - Choose `enable` or `disable`.

### DM Usage

The bot supports two types of commands:

**üè† Server-Only Commands:** These commands require server context and will show a helpful error message if used in DMs:
- All admin commands (`/setup`, `/postcode`, `/toggleautosend`, etc.)
- Server configuration commands (`/setlang`, `/favgames`, etc.)

**üì± Universal Commands:** These work anywhere and can be used in both servers and DMs:
- `/listcodes` - View active codes
- `/help` - Get help information  
- `/about` - Bot information
- `/vote` - Voting information

When a server-only command is used in DMs, the bot will respond with a clear explanation and guide users to use the command in a proper server.

### Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks around API calls.
- User-friendly error messages.
- Logging of errors for debugging purposes.

### API Integration

Uses the [HoYo Codes API](https://github.com/seriaati/hoyo-codes) to fetch the latest redemption codes for:
